# Reviving Hardware
## Exploration into reviving older hardware through self teaching.

Old computers have always been a source of joy and entertainment for me. I've
always wanted to build something new but never knew how or where to begin. Like
most people in my generation, we made do with hand-me-downs. Well, I got a
hand-me-down laptop with 2, out of 3, broken USB ports. I plan on repairing it
and going to the next level.
