# Reviving Hardware
## Exploration into reviving older hardware through self teaching.

--- DAY 1 ---
Like many people, when computers started boom, we knew one day the would 
begin to hit all new highs and we would have alot of old PC parts. Many 
people like to tinker and make new ones, and some like to crack the ones 
we already have. I, on the other hand, am just curious.

I am completing this project on (from before repair to completion) an old 
Acer Aspire E3400 (iirc). The computer was pinched in a recliner so the screen
has a permanent indent and 2 of 3 usb ports are nonfunctional. I'm planning on
replacing the usb ports, after I solve the headache of struggling to run 
a minimal linux distro, #!++ (CBPP (Crunch Bang plus plus for the
uncultured)). 

--- Day 2 ---
With the hardware struggling to maintain this, I am setting out on an
adventure to write a NEW KERNEL and NEW OS designed specifically around 
old hardware. Since I have AMD in the project device, I'm going to
start there. I plan on trying to update this everyday (if life allows, 
obviously). No promises there.

Well, all in all, I guess I'm going to learn a lot more than I expect,
I expect to have fun. Time to start looking into Intel architecture.

--- Day 3 ---
Well... who knew how programming langauges worked (besides their
authors obviously). It's astounding how much this is project is going
to grow. They sure didn't lie when they said learn Assembly. Since I
have an AMD based laptop, I'll be working with an AMD processor. This is
going to be a long journey. More plainly, all languages refer to the Op codes.
The op codes, refer to binary calls. Check your processor architecture if
you decide to do something like this, too.
